    My implementations of Merge Sort and Selection are inspired from the lecture slides.
    I made 2 main functions. The first one is used to read file from the currrent working directory to process data. The second one is used to interact with user to get array's size then process data from the number-shuffled array. If you want to use the first main, just commenting out th whole second main, and vice visa to use the second one.
    I made a .sh file to compile and  run it so we can do:
        ./run.sh
